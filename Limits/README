To prepare datacards for one particular text file use : 
-- python MakeDataCards.py text_file_name dir_name_to_save_datacards

To prepare datacards for optimization of a particular cut based on expected limits first test the MakeDataCards.py using one text file and if it works fine then use following : 
-- python MakeDataCardsForOptimization.py dir_name_where_all_text_files_are_kept.txt
where, dir_name_where_all_text_files_are_kept.txt is the directory in which you will kep all the text files. This script will take one textfile at one time and produce datacards 
for all mass points and then move them into a directory ''dir_name_where_all_text_files_are_kept'' and finallay all these datacards directories are then moved to a new directory 
''Datacards_dir_name_to_save_datacards'' where dir_name_to_save_datacards is the name you provided.
