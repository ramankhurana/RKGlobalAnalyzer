## Once you have the datacards for each file use following to combine the cards. 
python  CombineDataCards.py   DataCards_AnalysisTuples_V4626032016/


## Once you are back to the original directory where you produced the datacards
## run the limit estimation script for all the mass points
python RunLimitAllPoints.py  DataCards_AnalysisTuples_V4613042016/SPlusBFit

## For the plot use RunLimit.sh and plot_Asymptotic.C
