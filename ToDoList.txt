1. convert makecompile.sh --> Makefile
2. add all jet variables
3. add subjet/fatjet/ etc
4. put them in the jet validator
5. add total number of events
6. Make proper debug statements in each file.
7. Rename files like dijet ? 
8. Make variables virtual so that producers can move out of the main code. 
9. Fix the TLorenzVectorPart
10. Think of possible skims and implement them.
11. Fix sorting so that all number of jets can be accomodated.
12. Do a check if directory already exist, in that case don't create new dir. 
13. Add efficiency plots. 
  TotalEntries = dynamic_cast<TH1F*> (f->Get("totalentries"));



Things for Slides (7 July 2015) : 
-1. Theory Stuff from Fang-Ying 2-3 Slides. 
0. MET Trigger efficiency. 
1. Jet pT, eta, CSV, for leading and sub-leading jets.
2. MET, MET phi for raw MET. 
3. After Jet Selection Look at : 
   - DR (2 jets), dPhi (2 Jets), CSV Sum of 2 jets,
4a. Combine di-jet and MET
   - Look at MET
4. MET Cut and Look at :
   all the variables you want to look at. 
5. Individual Efficiency of every cut applied. 
6. Consecutive efficiency.
7. Cut Flow 
8. nEle, nMu, nJets, nTaus

9. Apply TTBar Control region and see the relevant distributions. 
10. Apply Z+Jets control region and see the relevant distribitions.
